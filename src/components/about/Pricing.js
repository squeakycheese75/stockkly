          1) Free! Well nothing is ever free, right! So we'll pop in some ads
          from time to time, add sponsored products and do clever stuff with
          your useage data to try and make stockkly better!
        </li>
        <li>
          2) Professional. No ads, sponsors and no using your data for anything.
        </li>
        <li>
          3) Corporate. So like Professional, no ads, sponsors or using the
          data. But we'll allow you to plug your own client data through
          Stockkly. (As far as we're converned it's your data!). You can give it
          to clients. We just add the live pricing and the functionality.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
